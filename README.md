# BealsConjecture
An attempt to find counter-examples to Beal's Conjecture.

Beal's Conjecture has an infinite number of combinations to try. Therefore, it is essential
to have a maximum value for C^z = A^x +B^y. I will generate all A^x and B^y less than the user
entered maximum value. I will store these values in an Array of linked Lists.
